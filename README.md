# 100daysofDataEngg
Repo contains my 100 days of Data Engineering journey from learning basics to advance python and sql, projects and learning other data warehouse tools and more

SQL important notes:
SQL standard way to explain anyone its a language helps talks to Database.

Why Database:
1. can store/handle massive amount of data which spreadsheets cannot
2. Security

DBMS :
Database is just storage which cannot handle/manage query So we have DBMS
that helps to magnage database like which query to give priority

Note: 
ORDER BY 
Nested sorting means in order by we can pass list of columns comma separated.
Nested sorting columns sequencing is important.
Nested sorting only make sense if you have repitition in your result we can take help of second column to refine it.
Nested sorting ( More refining the result)


Group By : Combines rows with the same value. 
           Aggregates a column by another column.
